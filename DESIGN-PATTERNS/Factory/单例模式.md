## the Singleton Pattern
> one-of-a-kind objects for which there is only one instance.
That's one and ONLY ONE object.

how do I prevent more than one object from being instantiated?

**The Singleton Pattern** ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.

- Three way to write singleton pattern 
    1. Synchronize the getInstance() method;
    2. Use eager instantiation
    3. Double-checked locking;

Singletons are meant to be used sparingly.

- Java's implementation of the Singleton Pattern makes use of a private constructor, a static method combined with a static variable.

in Java and C#, we should consider all applications multithreaded.

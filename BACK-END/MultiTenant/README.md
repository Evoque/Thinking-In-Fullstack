## 基本概念

- OAuth ( Open Authorization )
> OAuth协议为用户资源的授权提供了一个安全的、开放而又简易的标准。与以往的授权方式不同，OAUTH的授权不会使用第三方触及到用户的账号信息(如用户名与密码),即第三方无需使用用户的用户名与密码就可以申请获得该用户资源的授权，因此OAuth是安全的。

> An **open protocol** to allow **secure authorization** in a **simple** and **standard** method from web, mobile and desktop applications.
> The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables third-party applications to obtain limited access to a web service.

1. For Consumer Developers: OAuth is a simple way to publish and interact with protected data. It's also a safer and more secure way for people to give you access. We've kept it simple to save you time.
2. For Service Provider Developers: If you're storing protected data on your users' behalf, they shouldn't be spreading their passwords around the web to get access to it. Use OAuth to give your users access to their data while protecting their account credentials.



### OWIN ( Open Web Interface for .NET )

`OWIN` defines a standard interface between .NET web servers and web applications.  The goal of the OWIN interface is to **decouple server and application**, encourage the development of simple modules for .NET web development.
